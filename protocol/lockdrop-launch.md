# Lockdrop (Launch)

For launch, Membrane has 10M tokens up for grabs in the lockdrop that will linearly vest based on the individually chosen vesting period. At the end of the lockdrop, the deposited OSMO (minus \*operational fees) will be matched with an additional 10M MBRN, paired into an LP & sent to the Governance contract controlled by stakers. Operational fees are 400 OSMO used to create 3 **CDT** pools & 1 **MBRN** pool.

At the creation of the 4 pools, the CDT/OSMO & CDT/(axl)USDC pools will receive incentives, 1.5M/6months & 500k/3months respectively.

**Note:** The protocol is live at launch, so any testing can be done before investment
