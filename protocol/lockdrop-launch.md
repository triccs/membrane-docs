# Lockdrop (Launch)

For launch, Membrane has 10M tokens up for grabs in the lockdrop that will linearly vest based on the individually chosen vesting period, at a max of 3 months. At the end of the lockdrop, the deposited OSMO (minus _**operational fees**)_ will be matched with an additional 10M MBRN, paired into an LP & sent to the Governance contract controlled by stakers. _**Operational fees**_ are 201 OSMO used to create 1 **CDT** pools & 1 **MBRN** pool. This sets floating **MBRN** 3 months after launch to **20.75M or 20.75% of supply**.

After the creation of the 2 pools, the CDT/OSMO pool will receive incentives, 1.5M within the span of 8 months. The launch goal is to guarantee liquidity for **MBRN** so that **CDT** has a backstop from day 1, so participating in the lockdrop is akin to seeding the protocol's backstop.

**Note:** The protocol is deployed before launch starts, so users can experiment beforehand. The entire process is handled by a [smart contract](https://github.com/MembraneFinance/membrane-core/tree/main/contracts/launch).

**NOTE:** Claimed **MBRN** is staked
